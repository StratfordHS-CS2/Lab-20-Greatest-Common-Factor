# Lab 20 - Greatest Common Factor

In this lab you will be writing both the pseudocode algorithm, and the python implementation for finding the greatest common factor of two numbers.  

Here is some information about the greatest common factor.

### Instructions ###

1. In **main.py**, write pseudocode for your algorithm to find the greatest common factor of two numbers that are given to you.
2. Implement your algorithm by translating your pseudocode into Python in the `gcf()` function.
3. Run your code and check your results to see if your function works.
4. Once your code works, fix your algorithm (if necessary) and answer the question below the `gcf()` function.

### Manually Running Tests ###

After you have run your code and you think it is working, you can manually run the tests by following these steps.

1. Open a shell pane by pressing Ctrl-Shift-S.
2. In the shell window type the command "pip install pytest".
2. Then type the command "pytest".
